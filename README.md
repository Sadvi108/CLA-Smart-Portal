Project Structure

Here’s a (generalized) structure based on what’s in your repo:

/
├── app/                # Next.js app (pages, layouts, routes)
├── components/         # UI and feature components
├── contexts/           # React contexts for state sharing
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks and logic
├── lib/                # Utility libraries and helpers
├── public/             # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
├── styles/             # Global and module CSS / styling files
├── next.config.mjs
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── pnpm-lock.yaml / yarn.lock / package-lock.json
└── .gitignore


You can expand or adjust this depending on any additional folders (e.g. services, api, utils).

Configuration

If your portal requires environment variables, include a .env.local (or .env) file in the root with entries like:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL = https://api.example.com
NEXTAUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000
AUTH_SECRET = your_secret_key_here


Explain each variable’s role and default/fallback values.
